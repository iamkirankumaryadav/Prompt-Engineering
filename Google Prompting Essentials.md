# Google Prompting Essentials

### 5 Step Framework

A good prompt follows a simple framework.

### 1. Task (Personal, Format)
- You need to describe the task you want the GenAI tool to help you with.
- It should contain a **Persona** and a **Format** preference, so that the task is specific.
- Persona refers to what expertise you want the GenAI tool to draw from.
- You can ask the tool to take on a persona like a professional writer, or a marketing executive with 15 years of experience.
- You can ask it to create output for a specific audience, a customer, or a manager.
- You can be as detailed as you would like when adding a persona to your task.
- Format refers to how you want the output to appear, whether that's a bulleted list, summary, or table.

### 2. Context
- Necessary details to help the GenAI tool understand what you need from it.
  
### 3. References (Examples)
- Sometimes you will add references/examples for the GenAI tool to use while creating its output.
- With the help of examples the GenAI tool can give you a more useful output.
- There aren't always going to be clear references of what you need, especially when you are working on something more abstract.
- References give GenAI tools and examples to work from, and that can mean asking a GenAI tool to learn from the tone, style, or length of the reference provided.
- Providing multiple references/examples is also known as **few-shot prompting**. (Shot: Examples/References)
- Providing only one reference/example is known as **single-shot prompting**.
- Providing no references/examples is known as **zero-shot prompting**
- Between 2 to 5 references/examples is the sweet spot for a GenAI tool.
  
### 4. Evaluate
- Ask yourself if the input you provided gave you the desired/expected output.
  
### 5. Iterate
- If you evaluate and determine that you're not getting what you expect, you can try again by adding more information.
- Revisit the prompting framework (Make sure you are providing enough specificity in your task, context and references.)
- Separate your prompt into shorter sentences. Start by taking a long input and breaking it down into smaller tasks.
- You can break the long prompts into shorter prompts and input them as separate prompts.
- You'll input each prompt and receive an output, and then follow up with a new prompt until all of your tasks have been submitted.
- Try different phrasing or use the most common terms and simple language to elaborate the scenario or expectations.
- Introduce constraints (specifying filters and conditions) that might also help focus GenAI tools outputs.
- Adding constraints to prompts will help the GenAI tool narrow down its outputs and give you more helpful and unique.

The order of how you construct a prompt is less important than the context of the prompt itself.
