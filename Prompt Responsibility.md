# Using GenAI the Right Way:

### Think before you use it:
- Ask yourself: "Is GenAI really the best way to solve this problem?"
- Make sure it fits with what you need to do for your work and with your team.
- Check if your company or the law says it's okay to use GenAI for this.

### Be careful with data:
- Don't put secret or private company information into GenAI unless your company says it's safe.
- See if your company has a special version of GenAI for work.
- Never put your own private information into public GenAI tools.
- Always find out how your information might be used.

### Check the results:
 - GenAI can make mistakes, so look for errors or unfair biases.
 - If you share something that was generated by AI, let people know that AI was used.

# Hallucinations:

### What are hallucinations?
Sometimes, GenAI makes up things that aren't true or don't make sense.

### Why does it happen?
This often happens when you give GenAI unclear instructions.

### How to avoid problems?
Always double-check the information GenAI gives you to make sure it's accurate.
