# Prompt Engineering Glossary

### Prompt 
- A text-based input that instructs or guides a large language model (LLM) to generate a specific response.
- **Example:** "Write a poem about a robot who dreams of becoming a chef."

###  Large Language Model (LLM)
- A type of artificial intelligence that can process and generate human-like text.
- **Example:** Open AI (Chat GPT), Google (Gemini, LaMDA, Bert), Meta (Llama), Antrophic (Claude), etc.

### Response | Completion
- The output generated by the LLM in response to a prompt.
- **Example:** "The robot whirred with excitement, its metal eyes sparkling. It imagined the sizzle of bacon, the aroma of freshly baked bread, and the laughter of happy customers."

### Prompt Engineering Techniques

1. **Instructional Prompts:** 
- Clearly state the desired task or outcome.
- **Example:** "Summarize the following text in a single sentence."

2. **Contextual Prompts:** 
- Provide relevant background information to guide the LLM.
- **Example:** "Write a story about a detective investigating a mysterious disappearance in a small town."

3. **Example Prompts:** 
- Offer examples of the desired output.
- **Example:** "Write a poem in the style of Edgar Allan Poe, similar to 'The Raven.'"

4. **Question Prompts:** 
- Ask a specific question to elicit a targeted response.
- **Example:** "What is the capital of France?"

5. **Role-Playing Prompts:** 
- Assign a specific role or persona to the LLM.
- **Example:** "You are a knowledgeable AI assistant. Answer the following question as if you were a historian."

### **Temperature:** 
- A hyperparameter that controls the randomness of the LLM's output.
- Higher temperatures lead to more creative and diverse responses, while lower temperatures produce more focused and predictable outputs.
- **Example:** A temperature of 0.7 might produce a more creative response than a temperature of 0.2.

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices

1. **Clarity and Specificity:** 
- Ensure the prompt is clear, concise, and specific to avoid ambiguity.
- **Example:** Instead of "Write a story," try "Write a short story about a robot who falls in love with a human."

2. **Relevance and Context:** 
- Provide relevant context and information to guide the LLM's response.
- **Example:** If you want the LLM to write a poem about a specific event, provide details about the event.

3. **Iterative Refinement:** 
- Experiment with different prompts and refine them based on the LLM's responses.
- **Example:** If the LLM's response is not satisfactory, try rephrasing the prompt or providing more context.

4. **Bias Awareness:** 
- Be mindful of potential biases in the prompt and the LLM's responses.
- **Example:** Avoid prompts that perpetuate harmful stereotypes or biases.

5. **Ethical Considerations:** 
- Use prompt engineering responsibly and ethically.
- **Example:** Do not use LLMs to generate harmful or misleading content.
