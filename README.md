# Prompt Engineering

**Prompt Engineering** is about crafting ideal inputs to get the most out of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

1. **Token:** A unit easily understood by a language model.
2. **Tokenization:** The mechanism to split the inputs into tokens.
3. **Completion:** The Language model takes a prompt and creates a completion by constantly predicting the next token.

### Prompting
- The process of providing specific **instructions** (prompts) to receive new information or to achieve the desired outcome on a task.
- When we write a prompt for a GenAI tool, we give it a series of inputs and tell it what we want it to generate.
- Some GenAI tools can generate text or images, while others generate video, audio, or code.
- Prompting is both an art and a science. To get the best results we need to be precise in defining what we need.
- Providing context and setting parameters will get you the best output from GenAI.

### Applications
1. Brainstorm ideas and develop plans
2. Draft an email
3. Summarize meeting notes
4. Assign action items
5. Analyze data and spreadsheets
6. Turn insights into visuals
7. Create presentations
8. Create your AI agent

### GPT
- **G:** Generative (Generated data)
- **P:** Pre-trained (Trained on a large amount of data)
- **T:** Transformer (Language model architecture)
- Support multiple modalities (Accept inputs in the form of image, text, audio, video)

### What makes GPT stand out?
- **Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)**
- Part of the model training where humans give feedback based on the model's response.

### Context Window
- The amount of tokens you can have in the input and output while interacting with the LLM.

### Biases
- GPT is trained on data from the internet and various sources, including 1000 of books and websites.
- Since, this are written by humans, some of these training data contains offensive information.
- That can cause gender, racial, and other biases.
- e.g. If you ask GPT about doctors and nurses, it considers doctors as male and nurses as female.
- Fine-tuning can help to decrease the bias.

### Gemini
- Gemini has a huge context window as compared to Chat GPT.
- Gemini offers Vertex AI to integrate the LLM into their applications.
- Gemini leverages the transformer's architecture and mixture of experts.
