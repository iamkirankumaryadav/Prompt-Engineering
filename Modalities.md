# Modalities

- Different formats in which GenAI tools receive or produce information.
- Whether that's text, images, videos, audios, or code.
- Different GenAI tools are better at working in certain modalities.

### Image Generation
- Image generation prompts should specify size, color, position, and aesthetic.

### Multi Modal Prompting
- The essence of multimodal prompting is using different types of media to prompt a GenAI tool.
- Inputting image and text, or audio and text.
- Taking a picture of a chart and asking GenAI tool to explain the data in plain language.
- Sharing the audio and asking the GenAI tool to translate or transcript.
