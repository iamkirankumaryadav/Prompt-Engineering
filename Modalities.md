# Modalities
- The different types of data that an AI system can read, process, and generate.
- Think of modalities as different "senses" or forms of data.
1. **Text:** Written language.   
2. **Images:** Visual data.   
3. **Audio:** Sound data.   
4. **Video:** Moving visual data.
5. **Code:** Programming languages.   
6. **3D models:** three dimensional data.

### Multimodal GenAI:
- **Definition:** An AI that can handle multiple modalities is called "multimodal."
- **Example:** Taking both text + an image as input and generating a video as output.
- **Benefits:** Enables more natural, human-like interaction by integrating multiple types of information.

### Multimodal Prompting:
- **Definition:** The essence of multimodal prompting is using different types of media to prompt a GenAI tool.
- **Example:** Inputting image and text, or audio and text.
- Uploading a picture of a chart and asking for a plain language explanation.
- Providing audio + text and asking for translation or transcript.
