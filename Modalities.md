## ðŸ§  Modalities in AI

- Modalities refer to the various types of data that an AI system can interpret, process, and generate similar to how humans use different senses to perceive the world.

### Common Modalities Include:
1. **Text:** Written or typed language.
2. **Images:** Static visual content.
3. **Audio:** Sound-based data, including speech and music.
4. **Video:** Dynamic visual content combining images and audio.
5. **Code:** Programming languages and scripts.
6. **3D Models:** Spatial, three-dimensional (3D) representations.

## ðŸ¤– Multimodal Generative AI (GenAI)

### Definition:  
- Multimodal GenAI refers to AI systems capable of understanding and generating content across multiple modalities.

### Advantages:
- Enables richer, more intuitive interactions.  
- Mimics human communication by integrating diverse data types.  
- Supports complex tasks like visual storytelling, audio-visual analysis, and cross-modal translation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Multimodal Prompting

### Definition: 
- Multimodal prompting involves using a combination of media types (e.g., text, image, audio) to instruct or interact with a GenAI system.

### Examples:
- Uploading a chart image and asking for a simplified explanation in plain language.
- Providing an audio clip along with a text prompt to request transcription or translation.
- Combining text and image to generate a descriptive narrative or visual summary.
