## ðŸ§  Modalities in AI

- Modalities are different types of data an AI system can process and generate, similar to how humans use multiple senses.

### Common Modalities Include:
1. **Text:** Written or typed language.
2. **Images:** Static visual content.
3. **Audio:** Sound data, including speech and music.
4. **Video:** Dynamic visual content combining images and audio.
5. **Code:** Programming languages and scripts.
6. **3D Models:** Spatial, three-dimensional (3D) representations.

## ðŸ¤– Multimodal Generative AI (GenAI)

### Definition:  
- Multimodal GenAI refers to AI systems that can understand and generate content across multiple data types (modalities).

### Advantages:
- Provides richer and more natural user interactions.
- Simulates human communication by integrating diverse data sources.
- Enables complex tasks such as visual storytelling, audio-visual analysis, and cross-modal translation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Multimodal Prompting

### Definition: 
- Multimodal prompting uses a combination of media types (e.g., text, image, audio) to instruct or interact with a GenAI system.

### Examples:
- Upload a chart image and ask for a simplified explanation in plain language.
- Provide an audio clip with a text prompt for transcription or translation.
- Combine text and image to generate a descriptive narrative or visual summary.
