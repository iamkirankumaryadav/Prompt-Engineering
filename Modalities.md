# Modalities
- The different types of data that an AI system can read, process and generate.
- Think of modalities as different "senses" or forms of data. Common modalities include:

1. **Text:** Written language.   
2. **Images:** Visual data.   
3. **Audio:** Sound data.   
4. **Video:** Moving visual data.
5. **Code:** Programming language.   
6. **3D models:** three dimensional data.

### Multimodal GenAI:
- When a GenAI system can handle multiple modalities, it's called "multimodal."
- This means it can, for example, take both text and an image as input and generate a video as output.
- Multimodal AI allows AI to interact with the world in a more human-like way, where we naturally process information from multiple senses.

### Multimodal Prompting:
- The essence of multimodal prompting is using different types of media to prompt a GenAI tool.
- Inputting image and text, or audio and text.
- Taking a picture of a chart and asking GenAI tool to explain the data in plain language.
- Sharing the audio and asking the GenAI tool to translate or transcript.
