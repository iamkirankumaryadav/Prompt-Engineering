# Building Blocks for a perfect prompt

### 1. Persona
- Who do you want the AI to be? Please think of someone you'd like to ask for advice about your task.
- e.g. If you want to create a logo, a **graphic designer** will be the right person to set as a persona.
- If you want to create a workout plan, a fitness expert will be the right person to set as a persona.

### 2. Contextual Information (Context)
- What is the user's **background**? Provide relevant context or background information that the LLM can understand.
- What does **success** look like? Aim of the user? What **environment** are they in?
- Provide enough information to understand the context, aim, and objective to get accurate results.
- e.g. I'm an 80kg male (background) looking to reduce 5kg of excess fat (success) over the next 3 months. I don't have time for the gym, so home workouts for 1 hour will be enough (environment).

### 3. Task Specification (Task)
- Always start the sentence with an **action verb** and provide instructions with a clear goal.
- e.g. Generate, Give, Write, Draft, Analyze, Summarize, Translate etc.
- The task can be **one simple task** or **multiple task request**.
- e.g. Simple Task: Generate a 3-month workout plan for me.
- Multiple Task Request: **Search** for the best places to visit in Leh, **summarize** the top 3 places nearest to my hotel, and **order** them so that it does not waste any time while travelling.

### 4. Examples
- Showing the LLM some few shot examples where the reasoning process is explained in the examples.
- Placeholders: Create placeholders for specific information that will be filled in for each prompt instance.
- The LLM will also show the reasoning process when answering the prompt.
- The explanation of reasoning often leads to more accurate results.
- e.g. Rewrite the bullet points using the STAR framework: Situation, Task, Action, and Results (Example Structure)
- Here is my resume for reference "Copy and paste your resume content"
- The examples are not necessary for every prompt but including a relevant example improves the quality of your output.
