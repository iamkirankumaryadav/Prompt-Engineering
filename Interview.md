# Important Questions

### What is a prompt?
- A prompt is the input or instruction you provide to a LLM to guide its output.
- It can be a question, a statement, or a structured template that sets the context for the modelâ€™s response.

### Why is it important in AI systems?
- **Controls Output Quality:** A prompt directly affects the accuracy, tone, consistency and relevance of the response.
- **Defines Context:** Prompts help the model understand the persona, task, domain, instruction, context and guidelines.
- **Enables Specificity:** A well-crafted prompt reduces ambiguity, misunderstanding, improves reliability and consistency.
- **Supports Advanced Techniques:** Concepts like few-shot and zero-shot learning rely on prompt design to teach the model without retraining.
- **Impacts Performance:** Poor prompts can lead to hallucinations, bias, or irrelevant answers, while optimized prompts improve reliability.
