# Prompt Engineering Important Questions

### What is a prompt?
- A prompt is the input or instruction you give to a LLM to get a specific response.
- It can be a question, instruction, or structured template that sets the context for the model.

### Why prompts are important for LLMs?
- A well-creafted prompt improves the accuracy, tone, consistency, reliability, and relevance of the response.
- Prompts help the model understand the persona, task, domain, instruction, context and guidelines.
- A poor prompt can lead to ambiguity, misinterpretetion, hallucination, bias, or irrelevant answers.
- Concepts like few-shot and zero-shot learning rely on prompt design to teach the model without retraining.
- Poor prompts can lead to hallucinations, bias, or irrelevant answers, while optimized prompts improve reliability.

### What is prompt engineering?
- The practice of designing and refining inputs (prompts) to guide LLMs toward producing accurate, relevant, and context-aware outputs.
- Understanding how the model interprets language and leveraging that to achieve the desired result without retraining the model.
