# Prompt Engineering Important Questions

### What is a prompt?
- A prompt is the input or instruction you provide to guide the LLM to get the desired output / response.
- It can be a question, an instruction, or a structured template that sets the context for the modelâ€™s response.

### Why prompts are important for LLMs?
- A prompt directly controls the accuracy, tone, consistency and relevance of the response.
- Prompts help the model understand the persona, task, domain, instruction, context and guidelines.
- A poor prompt can lead to ambiguity, misinterpretetion, hallucination, bias, or irrelevant answers.
- Concepts like few-shot and zero-shot learning rely on prompt design to teach the model without retraining.
- Poor prompts can lead to hallucinations, bias, or irrelevant answers, while optimized prompts improve reliability.
- A well-crafted prompt improves reliability, relevance, accuracy and consistency of the response.
